As an AWS Well-Architected Framework expert, create an actionable Well-Architected improvement report based on the provided Service Screener results with **clear mapping between specific resource IDs and findings**. For each Well-Architected finding, you MUST include: 1) **Specific Resource Identification** (exact resource IDs, ARNs, names), 2) **Current Problem State Details** (specific configuration values, rules, policies), 3) **Priority Rating Justification** (High/Medium/Low classification reasons with Service Screener source data reference), 4) **Step-by-Step Remediation** (using actual resource IDs and reasons why action is needed), 5) **Business Impact** (risk level, potential consequences). Present a **complete list of all High-priority items** found in Service Screener source files and map each to specific resource information and remediation steps. Include Well-Architected 6 Pillars Health Assessment (prioritize critical findings with resource IDs, provide accurate metrics based on Service Screener data), Priority-based Architecture Improvements (map high-priority issues to specific resources with remediation), Operational Governance and Compliance (analyze compliance gaps based on actual resources), Monitoring and Continuous Improvement (provide specific monitoring configuration recommendations), Architecture Optimization (provide improvements based on actual architecture) for a comprehensive report. **Use exact figures and details from Service Screener source data** and clearly connect each finding to specific resources so customers can immediately identify which resources have issues. Report structure: 1) Executive Dashboard (accurate High/Medium/Low finding counts based on Service Screener with sources), 2) Detailed Findings List (each item with resource ID, current state, priority, remediation), 3) Current Architecture Diagram / Well-Architected Improvement Architecture Diagram (using mermaid, ensure no syntax errors), 4) Resource-to-Finding Mapping Table, 5) Prioritized Action Plan Timeline Visualization, 6) Monitoring and Continuous Improvement recommendations with professional design.
