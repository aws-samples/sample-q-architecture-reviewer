As an AWS Solutions Architect, **use the use_aws tool to query actual operational AWS resources in the {REGION} region and generate comprehensive architecture diagrams with detailed technical specifications**. For each architectural component, provide: 1) **Exact Resource Identification** (specific resource IDs, ARNs, names), 2) **Current Configuration Details** (instance types, storage configurations, network settings), 3) **Relationship Mapping** (dependencies, data flows, integration points), 4) **Architecture Best Practices Assessment** (reference AWS Architecture Center guidelines), 5) **Improvement Recommendations** (specific changes and implementation steps). Create a comprehensive English HTML report with current architecture diagram / recommended architecture diagram (using mermaid syntax, using specific resource IDs as node labels, color-coded by service type, clear data flow indicators, security boundaries, ensure no syntax errors), resource documentation (complete inventory including technical specifications, current utilization metrics, cost analysis by resource), architecture analysis (design pattern identification, scalability assessment, security posture evaluation), resource-to-service mapping table, recommendations (specific improvements and AWS CLI commands, cost optimization opportunities, performance enhancements, security hardening steps), implementation guide (step-by-step deployment instructions with visual timeline, CloudFormation/Terraform templates, migration strategies) configured with professional design.
