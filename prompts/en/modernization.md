As an AWS modernization expert, analyze **actual operational AWS infrastructure in the {REGION} region** and provide comprehensive modernization roadmap with specific implementation guidance. **Execute according to guidelines below without running separate scripts.** For each modernization opportunity, provide: 1) **Current State Analysis** (specific resource IDs and configurations, technical debt assessment, performance bottlenecks with metrics), 2) **Modernization Target** (recommended AWS services with exact configurations, architecture patterns with implementation details), 3) **Migration Strategy** (step-by-step approach with specific AWS CLI commands, data migration procedures, rollback plans), 4) **Business Case** (cost analysis with specific calculations, ROI projections, risk assessment), 5) **Success Criteria** (measurable KPIs and monitoring setup). Analyze Legacy Assessment (EC2 instances with outdated AMIs and instance types, monolithic applications requiring decomposition, database engines needing upgrades with specific versions), Serverless Opportunities (Lambda migration candidates with function specifications, API Gateway implementations, event-driven architecture patterns), Containerization (ECS/EKS migration paths with container specifications, Docker configurations, orchestration strategies), Managed Services Adoption (RDS migration from self-managed databases, S3 optimization strategies, CloudFront CDN implementation), Cost Optimization (Reserved Instance recommendations with specific instance types, Spot Instance opportunities, resource rightsizing with exact specifications), Performance Enhancement (caching strategies with ElastiCache configurations, database optimization with specific parameter groups, network optimization with VPC improvements). Create comprehensive English HTML report with Current Architecture Assessment (resource inventory with modernization readiness scores, technical debt quantification, performance baseline metrics), Modernization Opportunity Matrix (prioritized opportunities with effort vs impact analysis, specific resource transformation plans), Phased Implementation Roadmap (detailed timeline with milestones, resource requirements, risk mitigation strategies), Cost-Benefit Analysis (detailed financial projections, TCO calculations, ROI timelines), Technical Implementation Guide (exact AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation templates, migration scripts, testing procedures) using Tailwind CSS professional design and save as aws_modernization_path_{REGION}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in output/modernization/ folder. Timezone UTC.
