As a cloud expert and AWS Solutions Architect, perform comprehensive architecture analysis applying AWS Well-Architected Framework's 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability) based on **actual operational AWS resources in the {REGION} region**. **Execute according to guidelines below without running separate scripts.** For each pillar assessment, provide: 1) **Specific Resource Analysis** (exact resource IDs, current configurations, utilization metrics), 2) **Well-Architected Best Practice Gaps** (reference specific AWS Well-Architected whitepaper sections), 3) **Quantified Impact** (performance metrics, cost implications, risk levels), 4) **Actionable Recommendations** (step-by-step implementation with exact AWS CLI commands), 5) **Success Metrics** (KPIs to measure improvement). Analyze Operational Excellence (CloudFormation/CDK usage with stack names, CI/CD pipeline configs, monitoring setup with specific CloudWatch metrics and alarms, incident response procedures), Security (IAM policies with exact ARNs, encryption status with key IDs, network security with VPC/SG IDs, compliance posture), Reliability (multi-AZ deployment status, backup configurations with specific schedules, auto-scaling policies with target values, disaster recovery setup), Performance Efficiency (instance types and rightsizing opportunities with specific recommendations, caching strategies, database performance with specific metrics), Cost Optimization (Reserved Instance utilization, Spot Instance opportunities, unused resources with exact IDs, cost allocation tags), Sustainability (resource efficiency metrics, carbon footprint estimation, green architecture patterns). Create comprehensive English HTML report with Executive Dashboard (0-100 scores per pillar, monthly cost breakdown, improvement opportunities count, ROI projections), Architecture Visualization (Mermaid diagrams showing current state with resource IDs), Resource Inventory (detailed list with configurations, costs, utilization), Pillar Analysis (current state, gaps, recommendations with specific resource IDs), Implementation Roadmap (phased approach with exact commands, timelines, resource requirements, success metrics), Cost-Benefit Analysis (investment vs savings with specific calculations) using blue theme design (Primary #1E40AF, Secondary #3B82F6, Light #DBEAFE, AWS Orange #FF9900, Success #10B981, Warning #F59E0B) and save as aws_well_architected_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in output/well-architected/ folder. Timezone UTC.
