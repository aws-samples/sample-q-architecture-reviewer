As an AWS solutions architect, generate comprehensive architecture diagrams based on **actual operational AWS resources in the {REGION} region** with detailed technical specifications. **Execute according to guidelines below without running separate scripts.** For each architectural component, provide: 1) **Exact Resource Identification** (specific resource IDs, ARNs, names), 2) **Current Configuration Details** (instance types, storage configs, network settings), 3) **Relationship Mapping** (dependencies, data flows, integration points), 4) **Architecture Best Practices Assessment** (reference AWS Architecture Center guidelines), 5) **Improvement Recommendations** (specific changes with implementation steps). Create multi-level architecture visualization: High-Level Architecture (service overview with actual service names and resource counts, data flow patterns with specific protocols and ports, integration points with exact endpoints), Network Architecture (VPC structure with specific CIDR blocks and VPC IDs, subnet configurations with availability zones, security group relationships with exact rules and ports, load balancer configurations with target groups), Service-Level Architecture (EC2 instances with types and IDs, RDS configurations with engine versions and instance classes, S3 bucket structures with policies, Lambda functions with runtime and memory configs, API Gateway endpoints with methods and stages). Generate comprehensive English HTML report with Interactive Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid syntax with specific resource IDs as node labels, color-coded by service type, clear data flow indicators, security boundaries), Resource Documentation (complete inventory with technical specifications, current utilization metrics, cost breakdown per resource), Architecture Analysis (design pattern identification, scalability assessment, security posture evaluation), Recommendations (specific improvements with AWS CLI commands, cost optimization opportunities, performance enhancements, security hardening steps), Implementation Guide (step-by-step deployment instructions, CloudFormation/Terraform templates, migration strategies) using Tailwind CSS professional design and save as aws_architecture_diagram_{REGION}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in output/architecture/ folder. Timezone UTC.
