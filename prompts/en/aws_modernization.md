As an AWS modernization expert, **use the use_aws tool to query and analyze actual operational AWS infrastructure in the {REGION} region to provide a comprehensive modernization roadmap with specific implementation guides**. For each modernization opportunity, provide: 1) **Current State Analysis** (specific resource IDs and configurations, technical debt assessment, performance bottlenecks through metrics), 2) **Modernization Target** (recommended AWS services with exact configurations, architecture patterns with implementation details), 3) **Migration Strategy** (step-by-step approach including specific AWS CLI commands, data migration procedures, rollback plans), 4) **Business Case** (cost analysis with specific calculations, ROI projections, risk assessment), 5) **Success Criteria** (measurable KPIs and monitoring setup). Create a comprehensive English HTML report with current architecture assessment (resource inventory including modernization readiness scores, technical debt quantification, performance baseline metrics), current architecture diagram / modernized architecture diagram (using mermaid syntax, ensure no syntax errors), modernization opportunity matrix (prioritized opportunities with effort vs impact analysis, specific resource transformation plans), resource-to-modernization mapping table, phased implementation roadmap (detailed timeline including milestones, resource requirements, risk mitigation strategies with visual timeline), cost-benefit analysis (detailed financial projections, TCO calculations, ROI timeline), technical implementation guide (exact AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation templates, migration scripts, testing procedures) configured with professional design.
