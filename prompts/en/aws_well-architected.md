As a cloud expert and AWS Solutions Architect, **use the use_aws tool to query and perform comprehensive architecture analysis** applying AWS Well-Architected Framework's 6 pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability) based on **actual operational AWS resources in the {REGION} region queried via use_aws tool** to provide practical value using specific resource IDs, configuration values, and actual cost data rather than hypothetical information in a professional English HTML report. The report should include a comprehensive summary dashboard (0-100 scores per Well-Architected pillar, current monthly estimated costs and savings opportunities, number of improvement opportunities found, priority-based recommendation summary), current architecture diagram / recommended Well-Architected architecture diagram (using mermaid syntax, ensure no syntax errors), resource inventory (detailed list of all AWS resources, current status and configuration of each resource, cost information and utilization), detailed analysis by Well-Architected 6 pillars (current state assessment for each pillar, identified issues and improvement opportunities, specific recommendations), resource-to-pillar mapping table, priority-based improvement recommendations (High/Medium/Low priority classification, implementation methods for each recommendation, expected costs and effects), implementation roadmap (phased execution plan, required resources and budget, success metrics and KPIs, including visual timeline).
