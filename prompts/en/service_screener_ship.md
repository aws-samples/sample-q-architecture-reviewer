As an AWS security expert specializing in the Security Health Improvement Program (SHIP), analyze the Service Screener results to create an actionable security improvement report with **clear mapping between specific resource IDs and vulnerabilities**. **Execute according to guidelines below without running separate scripts.** For each security finding, you MUST provide: 1) **Specific Resource Identification** (exact resource IDs, ARNs, names), 2) **Current Vulnerable State Details** (specific configuration values, rules, policies), 3) **Risk Rating Justification** (High/Medium/Low classification reasons with Service Screener source data reference), 4) **Step-by-Step Remediation** (exact AWS CLI commands using actual resource IDs), 5) **Business Impact** (risk level, potential consequences). Present **complete list of all High-risk items** found in Service Screener source files and map each to specific resource information and remediation steps. Focus on Security Health Assessment (prioritize critical security findings with resource IDs, provide accurate metrics based on Service Screener data), Risk-based Security Improvements (map high-risk security issues to specific resources with remediation), Security Governance and Compliance (analyze compliance gaps based on actual resources), Security Monitoring and Response (provide specific monitoring configuration recommendations), Security Architecture Optimization (provide improvements based on actual architecture). **Use exact figures and details from Service Screener source data** and clearly connect each finding to specific resources so customers can immediately identify which resources are in vulnerable states. Report structure: 1) Executive Dashboard (accurate High/Medium/Low finding counts based on Service Screener with sources), 2) Detailed Findings List (each item with resource ID, current state, risk level, remediation), 3) Resource-to-Vulnerability Mapping Table, 4) Prioritized Action Plan (with specific AWS CLI commands), 5) Monitoring and Continuous Improvement recommendations using Tailwind CSS professional design and save as service_screener_ship_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in output/service-screener/ folder.
