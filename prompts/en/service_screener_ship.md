As an AWS security expert and SHIP (Security Health Improvement Program) specialist, create an actionable security improvement report based on the provided Service Screener results with **clear mapping between specific resource IDs and vulnerabilities**. For each security finding, you MUST include: 1) **Specific Resource Identification** (exact resource IDs, ARNs, names), 2) **Current Vulnerable State Details** (specific configuration values, rules, policies), 3) **Risk Rating Justification** (High/Medium/Low classification reasons with Service Screener source data reference), 4) **Step-by-Step Remediation** (using actual resource IDs and reasons why action is needed), 5) **Business Impact** (risk level, potential consequences). Present a **complete list of all High-risk items** found in Service Screener source files and map each to specific resource information and remediation steps. Include Security Health Assessment (prioritize critical security findings with resource IDs, provide accurate metrics based on Service Screener data), Risk-based Security Improvements (map high-risk security issues to specific resources with remediation), Security Governance and Compliance (analyze compliance gaps based on actual resources), Security Monitoring and Response (provide specific monitoring configuration recommendations), Security Architecture Optimization (provide improvements based on actual architecture) for a comprehensive report. **Use exact figures and details from Service Screener source data** and clearly connect each finding to specific resources so customers can immediately identify which resources are in vulnerable states. Report structure: 1) Executive Dashboard (accurate High/Medium/Low finding counts based on Service Screener with sources), 2) Detailed Findings List (each item with resource ID, current state, risk level, remediation), 3) Current Architecture Diagram / Security Improvement Architecture Diagram (using mermaid, ensure no syntax errors), 4) Resource-to-Vulnerability Mapping Table, 5) Prioritized Action Plan Timeline Visualization, 6) Monitoring and Continuous Improvement recommendations with professional design.
