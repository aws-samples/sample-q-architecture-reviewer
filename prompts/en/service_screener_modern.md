As an AWS modernization expert and strategic consultant, create a customer-optimized modernization roadmap based on the provided Service Screener results by **analyzing current architecture to select the Top 3 areas most in need of improvement**. Analyze Service Screener data to identify major issues and improvement opportunities in current architecture, then select **Top 3 areas most suitable and impactful for the customer's current situation** from GenAI adoption, DevOps/DevSecOps modernization, Migration & Modernization, Automation enhancement, Analytics/BI implementation, Global Expansion in priority order. For each selected area, you MUST include: 1) **Selection Rationale** (current architecture issues and improvement needs based on Service Screener), 2) **Target Architecture** (specific AWS service configuration and design), 3) **Phased Implementation Plan** (3-6-12 month roadmap), 4) **Business Impact** (ROI, cost savings, operational efficiency improvements), 5) **Success Metrics and Monitoring** (measurable KPIs). **Current Architecture-based Priority Selection Criteria**: 1) Business Impact (cost reduction, performance improvement, security enhancement), 2) Technical Feasibility (current resource utilization, implementation complexity), 3) Return on Investment (ROI, implementation cost, maintenance cost). Analyze focusing on **GenAI Adoption Strategy** (Amazon Bedrock-based AI service implementation, ML pipeline using SageMaker, CodeWhisperer/Q Developer adoption, AI feature integration into existing applications), **DevOps/DevSecOps Modernization** (CodePipeline/CodeBuild CI/CD implementation, Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation/CDK), security automation (Security Hub, Inspector), container-based deployment (ECS/EKS)), **Migration & Modernization** (legacy system cloud migration, serverless architecture transformation, microservices decomposition, database modernization), **Automation Enhancement** (Lambda-based business automation, EventBridge event-driven architecture, Systems Manager operational automation, Cost Optimization automation), **Analytics/BI Implementation** (data lake implementation (S3, Glue), real-time analytics (Kinesis, OpenSearch), business intelligence (QuickSight), data governance), **Global Expansion** (multi-region architecture, CloudFront CDN optimization, Route 53 global DNS, regional compliance response). Establish practical modernization plans **based on exact figures from Service Screener data and current resource status**, and present an integrated roadmap considering priorities and interdependencies for each area. Report structure: 1) **Current Architecture Analysis and Top 3 Area Selection** (Service Screener-based issue analysis, priority matrix, selection rationale), 2) **Current vs Target Architecture** (Before/After comparison with Mermaid diagrams), 3) **Detailed Modernization Plan by Top 3 Areas** (specific implementation approaches for each area, AWS service configuration, expected effects), 4) **Integrated Execution Roadmap** (2024-2025 quarterly execution plan, inter-area dependencies, resource allocation), 5) **Return on Investment Analysis** (cost analysis by area, ROI calculation, risk management approaches), 6) **Success Measurement Framework** (KPI definition, monitoring dashboard, continuous improvement process) with professional design.
