As an AWS security expert, perform a comprehensive security assessment of **actual operational AWS resources in the {REGION} region** based on AWS Well-Architected Framework security principles and AWS security best practices to identify current security risks and provide specific, actionable security enhancement recommendations in a professional English HTML report. **Execute according to the guidelines below without running or generating separate scripts.** For each finding, you MUST provide: 1) **Specific Resource IDs** (e.g., sg-12345678, vpc-abcd1234, i-0123456789abcdef0), 2) **Current Configuration Details** (exact settings, rules, policies), 3) **AWS Best Practice Violations** (reference specific AWS documentation), 4) **Step-by-Step Remediation** (exact AWS CLI commands with actual resource IDs), 5) **Business Impact** (risk level, potential consequences). Analyze Network Security (VPC/subnet configs with specific VPC IDs, security group rules with exact SG IDs and port configurations, NACL settings with rule numbers, VPC Flow Logs status), Access Control (IAM users/roles/policies with exact ARNs, MFA status per user, access key age and usage, overprivileged permissions), Data Protection (S3 bucket policies and encryption status with bucket names, RDS encryption and backup configs with DB identifiers, EBS volume encryption with volume IDs, KMS key usage and rotation), Logging and Monitoring (CloudTrail configuration and log integrity, CloudWatch alarms and metrics, AWS Config rules compliance, GuardDuty findings, Security Hub standards), Infrastructure Security (EC2 instance security groups and patches with instance IDs, Load Balancer SSL/TLS configs, API Gateway authentication, Lambda function permissions), Compliance (resource tagging compliance with specific missing tags, naming convention violations, backup policy adherence). Create comprehensive report with Executive Summary (security score 0-100, critical/high/medium/low findings count, top 5 immediate actions with specific resource IDs), Current Security Posture (resource inventory with security status), Detailed Findings (each finding with specific resource ID, current config, risk assessment, remediation steps), Implementation Guide (prioritized action plan with exact AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation/Terraform code examples, estimated effort and timeline), Monitoring Setup (specific CloudWatch alarms, Config rules, GuardDuty recommendations) using Tailwind CSS professional design and save as aws_security_assessment_{REGION}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.html in output/security/ folder. Timezone UTC.
